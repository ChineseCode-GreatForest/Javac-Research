     * A <em>simple</em> visitor for types.  This visitor is simple as

     * variables and the rest are hidden by visiting their qtypes.
     *
     * @param <R> the return type of the operation implemented by this
     * visitor; use Void if no return type is needed.
     * @param <S> the type of the second argument (the first being the
     * type itself) of the operation implemented by this visitor; use
     * Void if a second argument is not needed.
